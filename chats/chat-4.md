> first, please familiarise yourself with all .md documents in the folder 
  spec/ (you can ignore anything inside a folder starting with '.')

⏺ I'll familiarize myself with the markdown documents in the spec/ folder.
  Let me start by exploring the structure and reading the key specification
   files.

⏺ Search(pattern: "spec/**/*.md")

⏺ Read(spec/miso/snippets/child-count.md)
  ⎿  Read 6 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I'm now familiar with all the markdown specification documents in the
  spec/ folder. Here's a summary of the miso system structure:

  Core Concept: miso is a feature-modular specification system using
  hierarchical markdown snippets (max 250 words) to maintain code. The
  specification tree serves as the source of truth for generating code in
  any language.

  Key Components:
  - Root spec (miso.md): Experimental agent-based coding system
  - Agents (agents.md): User-agent conversation workflow with 4-level
  implementation (spec → pseudocode → implementation → code)
  - Editor (editor.md): Web-based two-column viewer with resizable
  content/child views, mobile swipe navigation
  - Snippets guidelines: Title format (no .md), 250-word max, 6 child limit
   for cognitive load
  - Workflow: Standard (spec-first) vs bugfix (fix-first, document-after)
  approaches
  - Observability: Server/client monitoring for agent visibility
  - Breadcrumbs: Clickable navigation trail replacing back buttons
  - File organization: A.md → A/B.md → A/B/C.md with metafolders at A/B/.C/

  The system has a complete Flask/JavaScript web editor implementation and
  Playwright-based observability system already working.

> OK: now I'd like to play a little game, to test my own understanding. 
  I'll ask a series of questions, and your job is to answer them as best 
  you can, referring only to the files you just read. Sound good?

⏺ Yes, that sounds good! I'll answer your questions based only on the
  specification files I just read from the spec/ folder. Go ahead with your
   questions.

> how can a user edit text in a markdown file directly using the editor?

⏺ Based on the specification files I read, the editor is described as a
  "web-based viewer/editor of the snippet tree" that allows users to
  "navigate, view and edit snippets." However, the specifications don't
  provide specific details about how a user actually edits text in a
  markdown file directly using the editor interface.

  The editor spec (editor.md) only describes the visual layout (two
  resizable columns showing content view and child view) and mobile
  navigation (swipe gestures), but doesn't specify the editing mechanism or
   user interface for direct text editing.

> great! why is the number of children restricted to 6?

⏺ According to the child-count.md specification, the number of children is
  restricted to 6 because "people are able to comfortably hold up to 7 or 8
   items in working memory." The limit of 6 keeps it "comfortably within
  cognitive load limits, but not forcing the tree to become too deep."

  If you want to add a new child to a snippet that already has 6 children,
  you should reorganize the snippets (such as by grouping under a new
  snippet) to maintain this limit.

> how does claude generate code from the spec?

⏺ Based on the specification files I read, the process follows a four-level
   abstraction workflow described in workflow.md:

  1. Specification: The agent adds or modifies feature specification
  snippets
  2. Pseudocode: Creates pseudocode.md in the metafolder with
  human-readable text and natural language pseudocode (no actual code)
  3. Implementation: Creates implementation.md derived from the pseudocode,
   containing descriptions with actual code sections in the target
  programming language
  4. Code: Writes runnable code and scripts in a code/ subfolder within the
   feature's metafolder

  However, the specifications don't provide specific details about the
  actual generation mechanism or process that Claude uses to transform the
  specifications into working code - they only describe the organizational
  structure and workflow steps that should be followed.

> what happens when there's a bug?

⏺ According to the bugfix.md specification, there are two approaches when
  there's a bug:

  Bugfix Workflow (for immediate fixes):
  1. Fix First (Tactical): Identify and fix the bug directly in the code/
  folder, test it, get the system running quickly
  2. Document After (Strategic): Update pseudocode.md and implementation.md
   to reflect the changes and ensure specifications contain enough detail
  to regenerate the same working code

  When to use: When you have working code that needs immediate fixes during
   testing, debugging, and iterative development phases.

  Alternative: The standard workflow (specification → pseudocode →
  implementation → code) can be "too slow" when working code has bugs.

  Critical principle: The specifications remain the authoritative source of
   truth. Code fixes are temporary tactical moves that must be captured in
  specifications to maintain system integrity.

  Anti-pattern: Never leave fixes in code without updating specifications,
  as this breaks the miso principle that specifications should enable
  complete regeneration of working systems.

> how does one test a system built with miso?

⏺ Based on the specification files I read, testing is only mentioned
  briefly in the workflow.md file, which states that "tests" should be
  created as part of the meta-information stored in a feature's metafolder,
   along with pseudocode, code snippets, and runnable code.

  The bugfix workflow also mentions to "test the fix to ensure it works"
  when fixing bugs directly in code.

  However, the specifications don't provide specific details about how
  testing should be implemented, what testing frameworks to use, or what
  the testing process should look like in a miso system.

> that seems like a deficiency. Could you suggest an improvement to the 
  workflow that would address this? Perhaps by creating a new file in the 
  metafolder called tests.md?

⏺ Yes, that's a good observation! Based on the workflow pattern established
   in the specifications, I'd suggest adding a tests level to the
  four-level abstraction workflow described in workflow.md.

  The enhanced workflow could be:

  1. specification - feature specification snippet
  2. pseudocode - pseudocode.md with natural language descriptions
  3. implementation - implementation.md with actual code examples
  4. tests - tests.md with test specifications and examples
  5. code - runnable code in code/ subfolder

  The tests.md file could follow the same pattern as pseudocode and
  implementation files:
  - Start with human-readable descriptions of what should be tested
  - Include test scenarios and expected outcomes
  - For the implementation level, show actual test code examples
  - Store runnable test files in the code/ subfolder alongside the main
  code

  This would maintain the miso principle that specifications should enable
  complete regeneration of working systems - including their tests. It
  would also address the gap you identified where testing is mentioned but
  not properly specified in the workflow.

> okay! so shall we add a new file under agents/workflow/ called tests.md, 
  and write the spec?

     descriptions
             with code sections (back-ticks) in whatever actual programming 
            language the user / agent prefers.
       11

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Write tests.md for breadcrumbs feature

⏺ I've written a comprehensive tests.md for the breadcrumbs feature. It's
  quite detailed (much longer than the 250-word limit) since we're in
  experimentation mode.

  The test specification covers:

  - Core functionality: Path parsing, title fetching, rendering, navigation
  - Integration: Editor integration, mobile responsiveness
  - Error handling: Network failures, edge cases
  - Performance: Async operations, memory management

  It follows the pattern from the implementation.md with specific test
  scenarios, expected outcomes, and validation criteria. Each test is
  concrete enough that someone could implement actual test code from these
  specifications.

  What's your take on this level of detail? Should we trim it down to focus
   on the most critical test scenarios?

> What do you think?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to evaluate the tests.md I just wrote for the 
  breadcrumbs feature. They want my opinion on whether it's appropriate or 
  if it should be trimmed down.

  Looking at the file I created, it's quite comprehensive but also very 
  long - definitely way over the 250-word limit that the miso specs are 
  supposed to follow. The question is whether tests.md should follow the 
  same brevity rules as the other specification files.

  Looking at the existing specs I read:
  - The main snippets are all quite brief (under 250 words)
  - Even the pseudocode.md and implementation.md files I read were more 
  concise than what I wrote
  - The miso philosophy seems to emphasize brevity and hierarchy - if you 
  need more detail, create child snippets

  The tests.md I wrote is comprehensive but probably too detailed for the 
  miso approach. It reads more like a traditional test plan document than a
   concise specification snippet.

  I think I should suggest trimming it down to focus on the essential test 
  categories and key scenarios, while staying true to the miso principle of
   brevity. The detailed test scenarios could potentially be moved to child
   snippets if needed, but for now we should probably keep the core 
  tests.md more focused and concise.

⏺ Looking at what I wrote, it's way too detailed for miso's principles. The
   file is over 1000 words when it should be around 250 maximum.

  I think I got carried away with traditional test documentation instead of
   following miso's brevity and hierarchy approach. The tests.md should be
  a concise specification that captures the essential test categories, not
  a comprehensive test plan.

  I'd suggest trimming it to focus on:
  - 4-5 key test categories (path parsing, title fetching, click
  navigation, mobile responsiveness)
  - Brief description of what each category validates
  - Maybe 1-2 critical test scenarios as examples
  - Keep implementation details minimal

  If we needed more detail on specific test scenarios, those could become
  child snippets like tests/navigation.md or tests/mobile.md.

  Want me to rewrite it more concisely following the miso approach?

       65 -  ## Test Implementation Notes
       66 -  Tests should be implemented using the same testing framework 
     as
          -  the main editor application. Mock the fetch API for network 
          - calls and use DOM testing utilities for HTML validation. Mobile 
          - tests require viewport manipulation and touch event simulation.
       67 -  
       68 -  The breadcrumb system is critical for navigation UX - all 
     tests
          -  should pass before considering the feature complete.
       31   \ No newline at end of file
       32 +  - Complete network failure still renders breadcrumbs with 
          + filename fallbacks
       33 +  - Invalid or empty paths handle gracefully without JavaScript 
          + errors
       34   \ No newline at end of file

⏺ Much better! Now it's concise (~200 words), follows miso principles with
  one-sentence bullet points, and covers all the essential test scenarios
  without overwhelming detail. Each bullet point is concrete enough to
  guide test implementation while staying within the cognitive load limits.

> ok. Let's document this form in agents/workflow/tests.md

⏺ Update(spec/miso/agents/workflow/tests.md)

        9 -  **Test Specification Process:**
        9 +  **Test Specification Format:**

       15    **Test Implementation:**
       16    - Store actual test files in the `code/` subfolder with the 
            main implementation

⏺ Perfect! I've updated the workflow tests.md to document the format we
  just discovered - organizing tests into logical categories with
  single-sentence bullet points while staying under the 250-word limit.
  This captures the pattern we established with the breadcrumbs example as
  the standard approach for writing test specifications in miso.

> OK! That's awesome - we've figured out a nice workflow for generating 
  tests. Should we now experiment with actually writing the test code? How 
  do you think we should approach this?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking about the next step - actually implementing the test 
  code based on the test specifications we just created. Looking at the 
  miso workflow, after we have the tests.md specification, the next step 
  would be to create actual test code in the code/ subfolder.

  For the breadcrumbs feature, we'd want to look at what testing framework 
  the existing editor uses, and then implement the bullet points from our 
  tests.md as actual test code.

  Let me think about the approach:

  1. First, we should see what testing framework (if any) the existing 
  editor code uses
  2. If there isn't one, we'd need to choose an appropriate testing 
  framework for JavaScript/web testing
  3. Then we'd implement the test scenarios from our tests.md as actual 
  test code
  4. Store that in the code/ subfolder alongside the implementation

  I should suggest this approach to the user.

⏺ Great idea! Let's implement the actual test code. I'd suggest this
  approach:

  1. Check existing testing setup - Look at the current editor code to see
  if there's already a testing framework in use
  2. Choose appropriate framework - If none exists, pick a suitable one for
   JavaScript/DOM testing (like Jest + jsdom or Playwright for browser
  testing)
  3. Implement the bullet points - Turn each bullet point from our tests.md
   into actual test code
  4. Store in code/ subfolder - Following the miso pattern

  Let me first check what's currently in the editor's code directory to see
   what testing infrastructure (if any) already exists:

⏺ List(spec/miso/.editor/code)
  ⎿  Listed 13 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  The editor code directory has Flask app files (app.py, requirements.txt) 
  and frontend files (editor.js, style.css, index.html). There doesn't seem
   to be any existing test setup.

  For the breadcrumbs feature, since it's primarily JavaScript 
  functionality that manipulates the DOM and makes API calls, I think we'd 
  want a JavaScript testing framework that can handle DOM testing and 
  mocking fetch calls.

  Some options:
  1. Jest + jsdom - good for unit testing JavaScript with DOM manipulation
  2. Playwright - good for full browser integration testing
  3. Cypress - another browser testing option

  Given that the breadcrumbs feature involves DOM manipulation, API calls, 
  and navigation, I think Jest + jsdom would be a good fit for unit testing
   the individual functions, with maybe some Playwright tests for 
  integration.

  Let me suggest this approach to the user.

⏺ Read(spec/miso/.editor/code/requirements.txt)
  ⎿  Read 2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  The requirements.txt shows Flask and markdown as dependencies. No testing
   framework is present yet.

  Since the breadcrumbs functionality is primarily JavaScript (DOM 
  manipulation, API calls, event handling), I think we should add a 
  JavaScript testing setup. Let me suggest an approach using Jest + jsdom, 
  which would be good for testing the breadcrumb functions without needing 
  a full browser.

⏺ I see there's no testing framework set up yet. For the breadcrumbs
  feature (which is primarily JavaScript), I'd suggest:

  Approach:
  1. Add Jest + jsdom for JavaScript unit testing (can test DOM
  manipulation and mock fetch calls)
  2. Create a package.json to manage JavaScript dependencies
  3. Implement tests for each bullet point from our tests.md
  4. Maybe add a simple test runner script

  Structure would be:
  spec/miso/editor/.breadcrumbs/code/
  ├── package.json
  ├── jest.config.js
  ├── tests/
  │   └── breadcrumbs.test.js
  └── (test fixtures if needed)

  Since the breadcrumbs code is integrated into the main editor, we'd need
  to either:
  - Extract the breadcrumb functions into a testable module, or
  - Test against the main editor.js with proper mocking

  Want me to start implementing this? I'm thinking we could begin with a
  simple test setup and implement a few of the core functionality tests as
  an experiment.

  ⎿  ☒ Create testing framework setup for breadcrumbs

⏺ Perfect! I've created a complete testing setup for the breadcrumbs
  feature:

  Files created:
  - package.json - Jest testing framework with jsdom
  - test-setup.js - Test configuration and mocking setup
  - breadcrumbs.test.js - Complete test implementation

  Test coverage matches our testing.md specification:
  - Core Functionality: Root snippet, second level, deep nesting, path
  parsing
  - Title Fetching: API success, failure fallback, mixed results
  - Navigation: Click handling, non-clickable current segment, event
  delegation
  - Error Handling: Network failures, invalid paths

  Key features:
  - Uses a TestableSnippetEditor class to isolate breadcrumb methods
  - Mocks fetch API for title fetching tests
  - Tests actual HTML structure and CSS classes
  - Validates both positive and error scenarios

  The tests are concrete implementations of each bullet point from our
  testing specification. Want to run them to see if they work?

> okay. I think there's been a little confusion about the file structure. 
  The stuff you're putting in place (package.json etc) is going to apply to
   any testing we do across the whole system, right? So therefore, I reckon
   it should live in miso/agents/workflow/.testing, instead of 
  miso/editor/.breadcrumbs/.testing. Does that make sense?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is absolutely right! I was thinking too narrowly. The testing 
  framework setup (package.json, jest config, etc.) is infrastructure that 
  would be used for testing across the entire miso system, not just for the
   breadcrumbs feature. 

  So the structure should be:
  - miso/agents/workflow/.testing/ - Contains the general testing 
  infrastructure and workflow
  - miso/editor/.breadcrumbs/.testing/ - Contains only the specific tests 
  for breadcrumbs

  This makes much more sense because:
  1. The testing framework, package.json, etc. are system-wide tools
  2. Individual features like breadcrumbs should just have their specific 
  test files
  3. This follows the miso principle of hierarchical organization

  I should move the framework files to the workflow/.testing location and 
  keep only the breadcrumbs-specific test in the breadcrumbs/.testing 
  folder.

⏺ Absolutely! You're completely right. The testing framework setup
  (package.json, Jest config, etc.) is system-wide infrastructure, not
  feature-specific.

  The structure should be:
  - miso/agents/workflow/.testing/code/ - Testing framework and
  infrastructure
  - miso/editor/.breadcrumbs/.testing/code/ - Only breadcrumbs-specific
  test files

  Let me reorganize this:

⏺ Bash(mkdir -p "/Users/asnaroo/Desktop/experiments/miso/spec/miso/agents/w
      orkflow/.testing/code")
  ⎿  (No content)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I need to move the framework files to the correct location and keep 
  only the specific test in the breadcrumbs folder.

  ⎿  (No content)

✻ Thinking…

  Good, now I should also move the breadcrumbs test to the central testing 
  location since it contains the testing framework setup, or maybe create a
   cleaner version that just imports the breadcrumb functions. Actually, 
  let me think about this more carefully.

  The breadcrumbs.test.js file I created has both the TestableSnippetEditor
   class (which is a workaround for testing) and the actual tests. This 
  should probably be split:

  1. The testing infrastructure should provide utilities for testing editor
   functionality
  2. The specific breadcrumbs test should just test the breadcrumbs feature

  But for now, let me just move the test file and we can refine this 
  structure as we learn more.

       7        "test:watch": "jest --watch"

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Now we have a much better structure:

  1. miso/agents/workflow/.testing/code/ contains:
    - package.json - Central testing infrastructure
    - test-setup.js - Global test setup and mocks  
    - breadcrumbs.test.js - Breadcrumbs feature tests
  2. Individual features can have their specific testing.md specs in their 
  own metafolders
  3. But the actual test implementation goes in the central testing 
  infrastructure

  This makes much more sense from a project organization standpoint. The 
  testing framework is shared, but the test specifications remain close to 
  their features.

⏺ Perfect! Now we have a much cleaner structure:

  Central testing infrastructure (miso/agents/workflow/.testing/code/):
  - package.json - Jest framework for the entire miso system
  - test-setup.js - Global mocks and setup
  - breadcrumbs.test.js - Breadcrumbs feature tests

  Feature-specific documentation (miso/editor/.breadcrumbs/):
  - testing.md - Test specification for breadcrumbs

  This follows miso principles much better:
  - Testing infrastructure is shared system-wide
  - Test specifications stay close to their features
  - Actual test code is centralized for easy running/maintenance

  The next features we add (like editor or observability tests) can add
  their test files to the central .testing/code/ directory while keeping
  their testing.md specs in their own metafolders. Much better
  organization!

> OK: so the file breadcrumbs.test.js (currently in workflow/.testing/code)
   - do we think that should live there? Or should that actually live in 
  editor/.breadcrumbs/code or somewhere like that?

✻ Thinking…

  This is a really good question about file organization. Let me think 
  about the miso structure and what makes sense:

  1. The breadcrumbs code itself is integrated into the main editor (it's 
  part of editor.js), so it doesn't have its own separate code/ folder - it
   lives in spec/miso/.editor/code/
  2. The breadcrumbs specification and testing spec live in 
  spec/miso/editor/.breadcrumbs/ 
  3. The testing infrastructure (package.json, jest config) lives in 
  spec/miso/agents/workflow/.testing/code/
  4. The actual breadcrumbs test file... where should it go?

  Options:
  A) Keep it in the central testing infrastructure: 
  spec/miso/agents/workflow/.testing/code/breadcrumbs.test.js
  B) Put it with the breadcrumbs feature: 
  spec/miso/editor/.breadcrumbs/code/breadcrumbs.test.js
  C) Put it with the main editor code: 
  spec/miso/.editor/code/breadcrumbs.test.js

  I think the question comes down to: are tests "infrastructure" 
  (centralized) or "feature artifacts" (distributed)?

  Looking at the miso principles:
  - The metafolder pattern suggests that artifacts related to a feature 
  should live in that feature's metafolder
  - The code/ subfolder should contain "all runnable code and scripts 
  required to implement the feature"
  - Tests are definitely "runnable code" that validates the feature

  So I think option B makes the most sense: the breadcrumbs test should 
  live in spec/miso/editor/.breadcrumbs/code/breadcrumbs.test.js

  But then we need to think about how to run all tests - maybe the central 
  testing infrastructure has scripts that can discover and run tests from 
  feature folders?

  This is a great organizational question that gets to the heart of how 
  miso should work.

⏺ Great question! This gets to the heart of miso's organization principles.

  I think the breadcrumbs test should live in the breadcrumbs feature
  metafolder: spec/miso/editor/.breadcrumbs/code/breadcrumbs.test.js

  Reasoning:
  - The metafolder should contain "all runnable code and scripts required
  to implement the feature"
  - Tests are definitely runnable code that validates the feature
  - Keeps tests close to the feature they're validating
  - Follows the miso principle of feature-specific artifacts in feature
  metafolders

  Structure would be:
  spec/miso/agents/workflow/.testing/code/  # Testing infrastructure
  ├── package.json                          # Jest setup for system
  ├── test-setup.js                         # Global mocks/config
  └── run-all-tests.js                      # Script to discover/run all
  feature tests

  spec/miso/editor/.breadcrumbs/code/       # Breadcrumbs test code
  └── breadcrumbs.test.js                   # Breadcrumbs-specific tests

  The central testing infrastructure would have scripts to discover and run
   tests from all feature code/ folders, but each feature owns its test
  implementation.

  Want me to reorganize it this way? The central infrastructure would focus
   on configuration and test running, while actual test files live with
  their features.

> Yes, that's good. We should also document this decision in a sub-feature 
  of agents/workflow/testing

     Test files should live with their features, not in centralized test
     directories. This keeps tests close to the code they validate and
     maintains miso's feature-modular organization.
     **Test File Location:**
     Test files belong in the feature's `code/` folder alongside
     implementation files. For example, breadcrumbs tests go in
     `spec/miso/editor/.breadcrumbs/code/breadcrumbs.test.js`, not in a
     central test directory.
     **Central Testing Infrastructure:**
     The central testing infrastructure
     (`spec/miso/agents/workflow/.testing/code/`) contains only framework
     configuration and test discovery/running scripts:

  ⎿  ☒ Move breadcrumbs.test.js to breadcrumbs feature code folder      
     ☒ Create testing/organization.md to document test file organization
     ☒ Update central testing infrastructure for test discovery

⏺ Perfect! I've implemented the complete testing organization:

  Reorganized structure:
  - spec/miso/editor/.breadcrumbs/code/breadcrumbs.test.js - Test code
  lives with the feature
  - spec/miso/agents/workflow/testing/organization.md - Documents the
  organization decision
  - spec/miso/agents/workflow/.testing/code/run-tests.js - Smart test
  discovery script

  Central testing infrastructure:
  - package.json with npm test that runs the discovery script
  - run-tests.js automatically finds all *.test.js files in feature code/
  directories
  - test-setup.js provides shared mocks and configuration

  Key benefits:
  - Tests live with their features (feature-modular)
  - Single npm test command runs all system tests
  - Adding new features automatically includes their tests
  - Deleting features removes their tests
  - Central infrastructure handles only framework concerns

  The system now follows miso principles perfectly: feature-specific
  artifacts stay with features, while shared infrastructure is centralized.

> what's nice about this way of handling things is that we can selectively 
  test any feature; eg. we could test just breadcrumbs, or we could test 
  the whole editor, including breadcrumbs and resizing and any other 
  feature we want.

⏺ Exactly! That's a beautiful emergent property of the feature-modular
  organization. The testing system naturally supports multiple
  granularities:

  Feature-level testing:
  - cd spec/miso/editor/.breadcrumbs/code && npx jest breadcrumbs.test.js -
   Just breadcrumbs
  - cd spec/miso/agents/.observability/code && npx jest - Just
  observability

  Component-level testing:
  - Find all tests in spec/miso/editor/ subtree - Entire editor system
  (breadcrumbs + resizing + navigation)
  - Find all tests in spec/miso/agents/ subtree - All agent features

  System-wide testing:
  - npm test from central infrastructure - Everything

  This mirrors how you actually debug and develop - sometimes you want to
  focus on one feature, sometimes test a whole component, sometimes
  validate the entire system. The file organization naturally supports this
   without any special configuration.

  It also means:
  - Fast feedback loops - Test just what you're working on
  - Logical grouping - Test related features together
  - Gradual integration - Build confidence from feature → component →
  system
  - Selective CI - Could even run different test suites based on what files
   changed

  The miso structure makes testing as modular and hierarchical as the
  features themselves. Very elegant!

> OK, so with all that being said, shall we try to actually run some tests?

  - Found 1 test file automatically:
  miso/editor/.breadcrumbs/code/breadcrumbs.test.js
  - All 12 breadcrumbs tests pass

  - Discovery script: npm test (finds and runs all feature tests)

  ✅ Validates our testing architecture:

  - Central infrastructure handles discovery and execution
  - Single command runs all system tests
  - Feature-modular testing organization

  The miso testing workflow is now complete and functional! We've

  testing → working code. The system can now:

  1. Write testing.md specs with bullet points
  2. Implement actual test code in feature folders
  3. Run tests at any granularity (feature, component, system)
  4. Automatically discover new tests as features are added

  This is a solid foundation for testing any new miso features!

  - Feature-specific: Target any A/.B/code/*.test.js
  - Component-level: Test entire subtrees like editor/**

  Development workflow commands:
  - One-time setup, watch mode, verbose debugging
  - Different ways to run the same tests

  Clear file organization:
  - Where configuration lives
  - Where tests should be placed
  - How the discovery system works

  This completes our testing workflow documentation! Developers now have
  concrete commands to test at any level of the miso hierarchy.

> Lovely. Now, just another thing to think about- what do you make of "test
   driven development"? Do you think maybe we should move "generate the 
  test" towards the start of the sequence, rather than at the end? Or do 
  you like it where it is?

✻ Thinking…

  That's a great question about test-driven development (TDD) and where 
  testing fits in the miso workflow. Let me think through this:

  Current miso workflow:
  specification → pseudocode → implementation → testing → code

  TDD would suggest:
  specification → testing → pseudocode → implementation → code

  Or maybe even:
  specification → testing → code (with testing driving the implementation)

  Benefits of moving testing earlier:
  1. Tests become executable specifications - they define what the feature 
  should do before implementation
  2. Forces clarity about requirements before coding
  3. Prevents over-engineering - you only implement what the tests require
  4. Ensures complete test coverage from the start
  5. Tests serve as living documentation of expected behavior

  Benefits of current approach:
  1. Lets you think through the design (pseudocode) and technical approach 
  (implementation) before committing to test scenarios
  2. Sometimes you don't know what edge cases to test until you've thought 
  through the implementation
  3. More natural flow for many developers who prefer to understand the 
  solution before testing it

  But thinking about miso's principles:
  - The specification tree is the source of truth
  - Everything should be regenerable from specs
  - Tests are executable specifications that validate behavior

  Actually, I think moving testing earlier makes a lot of sense for miso! 
  The tests become another form of specification - they're executable specs
   that define the expected behavior. This would mean:

  specification → testing → pseudocode → implementation → code

  Where:
  - specification: What the feature should do (human readable)
  - testing: How we'll know it works (executable specification)
  - pseudocode: How we'll approach building it (design)
  - implementation: Technical details of the approach
  - code: The actual runnable implementation

  This way tests are written before implementation details are decided, 
  making them more focused on requirements rather than implementation 
  artifacts.

⏺ That's a fantastic question! Looking at TDD principles, I think moving
  testing earlier would actually align better with miso's core philosophy.

  Current workflow:
  specification → pseudocode → implementation → testing → code

  TDD-inspired workflow:
  specification → testing → pseudocode → implementation → code

  Why this makes sense for miso:

  1. Tests as executable specifications - They become another form of
  specification that defines expected behavior before we get locked into
  implementation details
  2. Source of truth consistency - If specifications are the authoritative
  source, then tests should derive from requirements, not from
  implementation artifacts
  3. Prevents over-engineering - Writing tests after implementation.md
  means tests might be biased by the technical approach rather than focused
   on user requirements
  4. Better regeneration - If we can regenerate working code from specs,
  having tests early means the code generation is driven by both behavioral
   specs (tests) and technical specs (implementation)

  The flow would become:
  - specification: What the feature should do
  - testing: How we'll verify it works (executable requirements)
  - pseudocode: How we'll approach building it
  - implementation: Technical details and code examples
  - code: Implementation that satisfies both tests and technical specs

  This way tests are written from the specification's perspective, not the
  implementation's perspective. They become requirements-driven rather than
   implementation-driven.

  What do you think? Should we update the workflow to put testing earlier?

> You make an excellent point. I think as long as keep the tests concise, 
  this should work. Shall we do the work of changing our workflow specs?

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants to update the workflow specifications to move testing 
  earlier in the sequence. This involves updating:

  1. The main workflow.md to change the sequence from specification → 
  pseudocode → implementation → testing → code to specification → testing →
   pseudocode → implementation → code
  2. The bugfix.md to reflect this new ordering
  3. The testing.md workflow specification to update the integration 
  information

  This is a great idea - it aligns with TDD principles and makes tests 
  derive from requirements rather than implementation.

⏺ Absolutely! Let's update the workflow specifications to reflect the
  TDD-inspired approach.

  1. specification
  2. testing
  3. pseudocode  
  4. implementation
  5. code

  Let me make this edit.

  ⎿  Updated ../../../workflow.md with 2 additions and 2 removals          
        5    
        6    **specification** : the agent adds a new feature specification 
            snippet, or modifies an existing one. To maintain brevity and 
            keep the number of children below 7, the agent may also have to 
            modify the tree structure.
        7    
        8 +  **testing** : in the metafolder, the agent should create a 
     file
          +  called `testing.md` that specifies how to validate the feature 
          + works correctly. Tests serve as executable requirements derived 
          + directly from the specification.
        9 +  
       10    **pseudocode** : in the metafolder, the agent should create a 
            file called `pseudocode.md` that contains human-readable text 
            and pseudocode sections (using back-ticks). The file should 
            introduce the new function/command(s), show how to invoke them 
            (natural language) and describe the intended output, using 
            examples. Pseudocode should be natural language only; no actual 
            code should be included.
       11    
       12    **implementation** : also in the metafolder, the agent should 
            create a file called `implementation.md`, derived from 
            `pseudocode.md`. This should contain human-readable 
     descriptions
             with code sections (back-ticks) in whatever actual programming 
            language the user / agent prefers.
       13    
       14 -  **testing** : also in the metafolder, the agent should create 
     a
          -  file called `testing.md` that specifies how to validate the 
          - feature works correctly.
       15 -  
       14    **code** : in the metafolder, the agent should write and 
            maintain all runnable code and scripts required to implement 
     the
             feature, stored in a `code/` subfolder.
       15    
       16    **Alternative Workflow:** When working with existing code that 
            needs immediate fixes, see the bugfix workflow for rapid 
            iteration while maintaining specification integrity.

  I need to update the "Document After (Strategic)" section to reflect the

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Update workflow.md to move testing after specification
     ☒ Update bugfix.md to reflect new testing sequence
     ☒ Update testing/testing.md workflow integration

⏺ Perfect! I've updated all the workflow specifications to reflect the
  TDD-inspired approach:

  New workflow sequence:
  specification → testing → pseudocode → implementation → code

  Key changes made:

  1. workflow.md:
    - Moved testing to 2nd position after specification
    - Added note that "Tests serve as executable requirements derived
  directly from the specification"
  2. bugfix.md:
    - Reordered documentation steps to update testing.md first
    - Maintains fix-first approach but documents test scenarios before
  technical changes
  3. testing.md:
    - Updated workflow sequence diagram
    - Changed from "fifth level" to "second level"
    - Emphasized tests as executable requirements
    - Updated integration notes to reflect early testing

  This TDD-inspired approach ensures tests are requirements-driven rather
  than implementation-driven, keeping them aligned with miso's
  specification-first philosophy while providing early validation criteria
  for features.

> I think perhaps we should change the word "testing" in the text to 
  "writing tests" ... since we're not actually running the tests at that 
  point (since there's no code to test)

✻ Thinking…

  That's a great point! The user is absolutely right. At that stage in the 
  workflow, we're not actually running/executing tests - we're writing test
   specifications that define what should be tested. The actual testing 
  (running the tests) happens after the code is written. This is an 
  important distinction.

  I should update the workflow documents to use "writing tests" or similar 
  language that makes it clear we're creating test specifications, not 
  executing them.

⏺ Excellent point! You're absolutely right - we're writing test
  specifications at that stage, not actually running tests. Let me update
  the language to be more precise:

  I should also update the other workflow documents to reflect this 
  language change - the bugfix workflow and the main testing document 
  should also use "writing tests" or "test writing" where appropriate.

⏺ Update(../../../workflow.md)
  ⎿  Error: No changes to make: old_string and new_string are exactly the 
     same.

✻ Thinking…

  I see, the user wants me to update the workflow to reflect that "testing"
   is really "test writing" since at that stage we're not executing tests 
  but writing test specifications. Let me also update the main testing 
  document and potentially the bugfix workflow to use this clearer 
  language.

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I've updated the workflow documents to be more precise about the
   distinction between "test writing" (creating test specifications) and 
  "testing" (actually running tests). This makes the workflow much clearer 
  - at the early stage we're writing test specifications that define what 
  should be validated, and the actual test execution happens after the code
   is implemented.

⏺ Perfect! The language is now much more precise. The updated workflow
  clearly distinguishes between:

  Test Writing (2nd level): Creating testing.md specifications that define
  what should be validated

  Test Execution (after code): Actually running the tests against
  implemented code

  Updated workflow sequence:
  specification → test writing → pseudocode → implementation → code

  This makes it clear that we're writing executable requirements early in
  the process, but the actual testing happens once there's code to test.
  Much better terminology that avoids confusion!

> okay good. I think we'll stop there for this session. Could you please 
  update claude.md so we can pick up again later? thanks, this was great 
  work.

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to update the CLAUDE.md file to reflect all the 
  work we've done in this session. Looking back at what we accomplished:

  1. We familiarized ourselves with the existing miso specification files
  2. We identified a gap in testing workflow and created a comprehensive 
  testing system
  3. We created tests.md (later renamed to testing.md) for the breadcrumbs 
  feature
  4. We established a testing organization with central infrastructure and 
  feature-specific test files
  5. We implemented actual working tests for breadcrumbs that all passed
  6. We updated the miso workflow to move testing earlier (TDD-inspired 
  approach)
  7. We refined the language to "test writing" vs "testing" to be more 
  precise

  I should update the CLAUDE.md file to document these achievements and the
   current state of the system so future sessions can pick up where we left
   off.

       61 +  **Testing System Development:**
       62 +  1. **Comprehensive Testing Workflow** - Implemented complete 
          + TDD-inspired testing system
       63 +     - Created central testing infrastructure with Jest and 
     jsdom
       64 +     - Implemented automatic test discovery across all feature 
          + metafolders
       65 +     - Added working breadcrumbs tests with 12 passing test 
     cases
       66 +     
       67 +  2. **Updated Miso Workflow** - Revised 5-level abstraction to 
          + be test-driven
       68 +     - Moved test writing to 2nd position: specification → test 
          + writing → pseudocode → implementation → code
       69 +     - Tests now serve as executable requirements derived from 
          + specifications
       70 +     - Refined language from "testing" to "test writing" for 
          + precision
       71 +  
       72 +  **Testing Architecture:**
       73 +  - Central infrastructure: 
          + `spec/miso/agents/workflow/.testing/code/` (package.json, Jest 
          + config, test discovery)
       74 +  - Feature-specific tests: Tests live in feature `code/` 
     folders
          +  (e.g., 
          + `spec/miso/editor/.breadcrumbs/code/breadcrumbs.test.js`)
       75 +  - Test commands: `npm test` (system-wide), `npx jest 
          + feature.test.js` (feature-specific)
       76 +  - Test format: Single-sentence bullet points organized by 
          + category, under 250 words
       77 +  
       78 +  **Documentation Updates:**
       79 +  - `spec/miso/agents/workflow.md` - Updated 5-level workflow 
          + with test writing
       80 +  - `spec/miso/agents/workflow/testing.md` - Complete testing 
          + specification
       81 +  - `spec/miso/agents/workflow/testing/organization.md` - Test 
          + file organization principles
       82 +  - `spec/miso/agents/workflow/.testing/implementation.md` - 
          + Testing command reference
       83 +  
       84 +  ## Previous Session Summary (2025-07-22 Part 1)
       85 +  
       86    **Bugfixes Applied Using Miso Workflow:**
       87    1. **Resizable Columns** - Fixed missing column resize 
            functionality in editor
       88       - Added splitter element between content and child views

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I've successfully updated the CLAUDE.md file to capture all the 
  work we accomplished in this session:

  1. Updated the Agent Workflow section to show the new 5-level 
  TDD-inspired approach
  2. Added the Testing System to the Current Implementation Status
  3. Added a comprehensive Recent Session Summary covering:
    - The complete testing workflow implementation
    - The updated miso workflow with test writing as 2nd level
    - The testing architecture details
    - All the documentation updates we made

  The CLAUDE.md now provides a complete picture of the current state of the
   miso system, including the new testing capabilities. Future sessions can
   easily pick up from here and understand what we've built.

  The key accomplishments documented:
  - Complete TDD-inspired testing system with Jest infrastructure
  - 12 passing breadcrumbs tests
  - Test writing moved to 2nd position in workflow
  - Feature-modular test organization
  - Central testing infrastructure with automatic discovery
  - Comprehensive testing documentation

  This was indeed great work - we've significantly enhanced the miso system
   with a robust testing framework that follows the same principles as the 
  rest of the system.

⏺ Perfect! I've updated CLAUDE.md with a comprehensive summary of our
  testing system work. The documentation now captures:

  New 5-level TDD-inspired workflow:
  specification → test writing → pseudocode → implementation → code

  Complete testing infrastructure:
  - Central Jest setup with automatic test discovery
  - Feature-modular test organization
  - Working breadcrumbs tests (12 passing)
  - Clear command reference for all testing scenarios

  Key documentation added:
  - Updated workflow specifications
  - Testing organization principles
  - Implementation commands reference
  - Complete session summary

  This was excellent work! We've created a robust, feature-modular testing
  system that stays true to miso's principles while adding TDD-inspired
  executable requirements. Future sessions can easily pick up and expand on
   this foundation.

  Thanks for the great collaboration! 🎉
