- workflow needs to be setup manually every time
- observability tools need to be setup
- read over all old chats in order? maybe?
- need to be able to "compile" workflows down into scripts

this is the stuff that should happen automatically.

the big question is: is it easier to converse with an agent? Or easier to just write a new feature and have the LLM poke it into the right place in the tree?
