_we are human mode_

We are Human Mode building h.id, a system for product observability. 

We want to make it easier for people to buy from people.

It's harder than ever for small businesses to stand out in online marketplaces. At the same time, buyers want to find and support smaller artisans making original, thoughtful works.

Human Mode exists to bridge that gap.

We're building tools that spotlight originality, authenticity, and craftsmanship to help creators tell their story and buyers make informed choices.

We believe in a future where technology amplifies human creativity, not replaces it, and where buyers can connect with the people behind the products they love.

We're always happy to connect with new people hello@humanm. Our shared email is hello@humanmode.id. We have 2 cofounders Horatio (horatio@humanmode.id) and Helios (helios@humanmode.id) working on strategy/fit and stack/product respectively.
