# logos
_obviously the most important bit_

The 'human mode' in serif font, where 'human' is italicized and 'mode' is bold (non-italicized). Between the two words is a toggle switch in the ON position, indicating human-mode is activated. The toggle is centered vertically with the words, so that they look like they're all in a line. 

There should also be the logos of the sites that we support at the bottom of the page. The actual PNGs/SVGs for those logos are provided below. The logos should be dynamically resized to be around the same size accounting for their dimensions, and aligned vertically.
