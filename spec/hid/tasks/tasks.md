# tasks
_core system components_

The h.id system performs three sequential analysis tasks:
- `search` - Extract product metadata from URLs
- `mask` - Segment product images for analysis  
- `detect` - Score AI generation likelihood

Each task appears as a progressive card in the interface, building user confidence through immediate feedback and manual progression controls.
