# api
_external data integration_

Integrate with Diffbot Product API for extracting structured data from e-commerce pages. API calls only when products don't exist in internal database.

Handle API errors gracefully with clear user feedback. Normalize responses into consistent format regardless of source platform.

Cache all successful responses locally to minimize external dependencies and improve response times for repeat queries.
