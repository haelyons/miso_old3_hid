_URL recognition and extraction_

Identify supported e-commerce platforms and extract product identifiers using predefined regex patterns. Handle URL variations and normalize inputs across Etsy, RedBubble, and Alibaba.

Validation provides immediate user feedback through border color changes: neutral for incomplete, green for valid, red for unsupported URLs.

Extract merchant name, product ID, and optional seller handle for database lookup and API calls.
