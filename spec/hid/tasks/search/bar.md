# bar
_interactive product URL input_

A responsive search form for entering a product URL. The input field provides immediate visual feedback, changing color to indicate whether the current URL is valid and from a supported platform.

The form includes a submission button, which is enabled only when a valid URL is entered. This ensures that only well-formed requests are sent to the backend for processing. The button's appearance also changes to reflect its state (e.g., disabled, submitting).
