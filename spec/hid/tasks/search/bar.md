# bar
_not the dark kind, the web kind_

Minimal search bar to enter a product URL. The arrow should be to the right of it. It should be a plain, stylised arrow vertically centered with the bar. When you hover it should have a circular border that appears around it, matching the Y dimensions of the bar.
