_URL input form_

Persistent search form remains visible throughout user session, allowing new URL input at any time. Input and submit button float directly on page background without container borders, maintaining clean aesthetic.

Input validation provides instant visual feedback through border color changes: neutral or blue for incomplete, green for valid, red for unsupported URLs.

Submit button positioned as clean icon adjacent to input with subtle hover states. Button reflects input state: dark when enabled, gray when disabled. Loading state shows subtle spinner animation.

Placeholder guides users: "Paste Etsy or RedBubble product URL here". Borderless design emphasizes content over interface chrome.
