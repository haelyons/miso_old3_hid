_Human Mode identity elements_

Top-left menu bar displays "human mode" logo with interactive toggle switch positioned between "human" (italic) and "mode" (bold). Toggle switch sized to align with median character height, creating seamless integration with logo text. Menu bar has no styling to preserve clean background aesthetic.

Toggle switch uses standard native UI elements found in the platform's component library. Prefer basic, rounded interactive toggle elements rather than custom implementations. Switch must be fully functional, toggling between states when clicked. Size should match median character height exactly for visual harmony with surrounding logo text.
