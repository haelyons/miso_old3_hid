_Human Mode identity elements_

Top-left menu bar displays "human mode" logo with interactive toggle switch positioned between "human" (italic) and "mode" (bold). Toggle switch sized to align with median character height, creating seamless integration with logo text. Menu bar has no styling to preserve clean background aesthetic.

Toggle switch serves as core visual metaphor for switching into human mode and functional UI element. Modern rounded design with smooth transitions.

"Certified Human©" appears as main heading with superscript ©. Subtitle "Helping small artisans stand out" clarifies mission.

Warm, trustworthy aesthetic using serif fonts for logos and quality paper-colored background (#fffdf2) rather than stark white.
