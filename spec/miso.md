# miso
*an experimental system for writing code using hierarchical specifications*

`miso` is a sytem to allow laypersons to write code with the help of agents, while creating systems that are robust, understandable and maintainable.

`miso` introduces the concept of feature-modular specification - a tree of markdown files called *snippets*. Each snippet is a short (250-300 word) summary of a feature, and has up to six child snippets that add detail to the summary.

The user "writes code" by editing the specification; the agent works in the background to "make it so".
