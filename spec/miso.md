# miso
an experimental system for writing code using hierarchical specifications

`miso` is a sytem to allow laypersons to write code with the help of agents, while creating systems that are robust, understandable and maintainable.

`miso` introduces the concept of *feature-modular specification* - a tree of markdown files called *snippets*. Each snippet is a short (250-300 word) summary of a feature, and has up to six child snippets that add detail to the summary.

The user converses with the agent to understand and modify the feature tree, and from this generate working code.
