# h.id
_a product observability layer for e-commerce_

`h.id` is an initiative to help artists and consumers regain control of the product that they are buying by identifying if the product pictures are AI generated.

we use the `miso` system of feature-modular specification for our main site / app to allow us to retain a keen product and functionality focus.

the initial product for `h.id` is about parsing user inputs, interacting with specified services for our backend, and providing some result that helps the user make an informed choice.

the current implementation throughline for us is speed and observability. we want users to instantly get the feeling that they are moving forward in their journey to know more, and learn more, about their products.
