# h.id
_a product observability layer for e-commerce_

`h.id` is an initiative to help artists and consumers regain control of the product that they are buying by identifying if the product pictures are AI generated.

we use the `miso` system of feature-modular specification for our main site / app to allow us to retain a keen product and functionality focus.

the initial product for `h.id` is about parsing user inputs, interacting with specified services for our backend, and providing some result that helps the user make an informed choice.
