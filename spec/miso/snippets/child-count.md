*restricting the number of child snippets*

It's been shown that people are able to comfortably hold up to 7 or 8 items in working memory. For this reason, we restrict the number of children of a snippet to 6; comfortably within cognitive load limits, but not forcing the tree to become too deep.

If we want to add a new child to a snippet that already has 6 children, we should reorganise the snippets (such as by grouping under a new snippet) to maintain this limit.
