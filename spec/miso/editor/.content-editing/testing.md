*validating content editing functionality through systematic test cases*

**UI Component Tests:**
- Edit button appears at right edge of content view next to snippet title
- Edit button has appropriate styling and hover effects
- Button text changes from "Edit" to "Save" when in edit mode
- Cancel button appears alongside Save button in edit mode
- Buttons are positioned consistently across different content lengths

**Edit Mode Transition Tests:**
- Clicking Edit button transforms rendered content to textarea with raw markdown
- Textarea contains exact markdown source from the current snippet file
- Textarea has appropriate styling with monospace font and proper sizing
- Textarea automatically focuses when entering edit mode
- View mode restores rendered markdown display when exiting edit mode

**Content Modification Tests:**
- Changes made in textarea are preserved during edit session
- Save action writes modified content to correct .md file on filesystem
- Save action updates rendered view with newly modified content
- Cancel action discards changes and restores original content display
- Multiple edit sessions on same snippet maintain content integrity

**Integration Tests:**
- Edit mode works correctly with breadcrumb navigation functionality
- Edit mode integrates properly with add-subfeature workflow
- Navigation away from snippet while editing handles state appropriately
- Edit mode maintains proper layout with existing single-column design

**File System Tests:**
- Content changes are written to correct file path based on current snippet
- File modifications preserve proper markdown formatting and structure
- Error handling for file write failures displays appropriate user feedback
