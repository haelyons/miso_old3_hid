*child items show timestamps and are sorted by recency*

Child items display vertically with title on first line, summary below. Title line includes right-aligned last-edited timestamp in small gray text. Children sort by most recent first.

All buttons (edit, save, cancel, +, recent) align to right edge of containers. Child view has minimal horizontal padding for tight layout.
