# horizontal-children
*child items display title and summary on the same line*

Child items in the children view should display the title and summary horizontally on a single line rather than stacked vertically. The title appears on the left as a clickable link, followed by the summary text on the right side of the same line.

This horizontal layout reduces the vertical space each child item occupies, allowing more children to be visible without scrolling. The title maintains its blue color and bold styling to indicate it's clickable, while the summary appears in lighter gray italic text to the right.

The layout should be responsive, with the summary text wrapping or truncating appropriately on smaller screens to prevent overflow while keeping both elements on the same horizontal line.

This change makes the children list more compact and scannable, similar to file listings or directory views where the name and description appear side by side.
