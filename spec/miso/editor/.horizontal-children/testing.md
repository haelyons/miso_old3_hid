# testing horizontal children layout

**Layout Structure:**
- Child item title and summary appear on the same horizontal line
- Title appears on the left side of the child item
- Summary appears on the right side of the same line
- No vertical stacking of title above summary

**Visual Styling:**
- Title maintains blue color and bold font weight
- Summary uses gray italic styling as before
- Both elements remain within the child item container
- Proper spacing between title and summary text

**Responsive Behavior:**
- Layout remains horizontal on both desktop and mobile
- Summary text wraps or truncates to prevent overflow
- Title and summary stay on same line even on narrow screens
- Click target area covers the entire child item

**Space Efficiency:**
- Each child item takes less vertical space than before
- More children visible in the children view without scrolling
- Compact appearance similar to file directory listings
