# auto-scroll
*automatic scroll to top when navigating between pages*

When users navigate to a new page (either by clicking breadcrumbs, child items, or items in the changes list), the browser should automatically scroll to the top of the page to ensure they start reading from the beginning of the new content.

This provides a consistent and smooth user experience, preventing users from being left partway down the page when they expect to see the start of new content. The auto-scroll behavior applies to all navigation methods including snippet loading and changes page loading.

The page should smoothly position at the very top whenever new content is loaded, making navigation feel more polished and predictable.
