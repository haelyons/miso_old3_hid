# testing
*validating add-subfeature functionality through systematic test cases*

**UI Component Tests:**
- Plus button appears to the right of "children (N)" heading when children exist
- Plus button appears to the right of "no children" heading when no children exist
- Clicking plus button creates new editable child item at top of children list
- New child item has two input fields: title and summary
- Input fields have appropriate placeholder text and styling

**User Interaction Tests:**
- Tab key moves focus from title field to summary field
- Enter key in summary field triggers save action when both fields filled
- Escape key cancels creation and removes temporary child item
- Clicking outside edit area cancels creation and removes temporary child item
- Cannot save with empty title field or empty summary field

**File System Integration Tests:**
- Save action creates new .md file in correct directory based on current snippet location
- Filename is generated from title using lowercase, hyphenated convention
- New file contains properly formatted markdown with title and summary
- File creation handles special characters and spaces in title appropriately

**Navigation and State Tests:**
- After successful creation, editor navigates to newly created snippet
- Cancellation returns to previous state without navigation changes
- Multiple rapid clicks on plus button do not create multiple edit items
- Edit state is properly cleared after save or cancel operations
