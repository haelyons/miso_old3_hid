# editor
*web-based viewer/editor of the snippet tree*

`miso`'s web-based editor allows the user to navigate, view and edit snippets. It has a two resizable columns:

- the content view, which shows a single snippet as rendered markdown
- the child view, which shows each child snippet as a title and one-line summary

For mobile users, the main screen should show only the content view, and swiping left from the right-hand edge of the screen should bring in the child view; swiping right from the left-hand edge of the screen should navigate up to the parent.
