# editor
*web-based viewer/editor of the snippet tree*

`miso`'s web-based editor allows the user to navigate, view and edit snippets. It uses a single-column layout like this:

- the content view shows a single snippet as rendered markdown at the top with subtle horizontal separator below summary

- the child view appears below the content, showing each child snippet with title, last-edited time, and summary. Children are sorted most recent first. All buttons (edit, save, cancel, +, recent) align to the right edge of their containers.
