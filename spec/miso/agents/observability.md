# observability
*ensuring that the agent can monitor both server and client*

At all times, both user and agent should be able to monitor

- the activity of the server (including all debug outputs)
- activity on the client (what URL, HTML is being rendered, console output)

This avoids the user having to act as the "eyes and ears" of the agent, streamlining the workflow.
