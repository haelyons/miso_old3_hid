# chat
*collaboration between multiple humans and gents*

The chat UI is similar to a slack channel; it sits in a new leftmost column (to the left of the content and children views). The chat can contain multiple human users and multiple agents. The constraint is that everyone in the chat sees the same snippet(s), and all edits happen only to the visible snippet.

While viewing any snippet, we can rewind its state; this jumps to the chat conversation that modified it, and lets us skip backwards and forwards to see how the snippet tree evolved. This is useful because it lets us understand and critique how a feature came to be.

As a handy side-effect, it also makes for a great demo tool.
