# snippets

*what makes a good snippet*

All snippets should start with a '#' title followed by an *emphasized* one-line summary.

A good snippet should be short - a maximum of about 250 words, or about the size of an abstract of a paper, a tweet, or a paragraph - and should summarise the purpose of the feature it describes.

The goal is for users and LLMs to be able to quickly read and understand a topic at the top-level, only drilling down to sub-features if required.

Conversely, if we want to add detail to a snippet, the correct way to do so is to create a child snippet, rather than editing the original. Editing the original is permissible, but only if we respect length limits.
